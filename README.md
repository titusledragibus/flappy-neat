# Flappy NEAT
This program trains an AI to play Flappy Bird using the NEAT algorithm.

## Requirements
* neat-python
* pygame
* pickle

## How it works
This program uses the Neuro Evolution of Augmenting Topologies algorithm. Unlike standard
neuroevolution, which has a fixed network structure, NEAT learns the best architecture. 

## Usage
To train, run 
<br />
`python3 main.py train`
<br /><br />
To run, run <br />
`python3 main.py run`

## Debugging
Open main.py in your editor and you can edit all the variables for the classes `Run` and `Train`.
